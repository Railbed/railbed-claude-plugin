# Railbed plugin for Claude

The official plugin for [Railbed](https://railbed.com), card checkout for online merchants that mainstream processors turn away. It connects Claude to Railbed's hosted [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server and adds skills and a review agent for building and running a Railbed integration. It is built for Claude Code, Cowork, and claude.ai chat on the web, desktop and mobile.

Buyers pay by card through independent, licensed providers, and every sale settles as USDC on Polygon to a wallet the merchant controls. Railbed never holds funds.

## Install

**Claude Code**

```text
/plugin marketplace add Railbed/railbed-claude-plugin
/plugin install railbed@railbed
```

Then run `/mcp`, choose `plugin:railbed:railbed` and pick **Authenticate**. Railbed's sign-in page opens in your browser.

If you already added Railbed's server yourself (`claude mcp add … https://mcp.railbed.io/mcp`), Claude Code matches servers by address and uses your own entry instead of the plugin's copy. Both reach the same server, and the skills and agent work with either.

**claude.ai, the desktop app and Cowork**

Open **Customize → Plugins**, add the `Railbed/railbed-claude-plugin` repository as a marketplace and select **Add** on **Railbed**. Adding the plugin doesn't add its connector: open the plugin's **Connectors** tab, add Railbed if it shows **Not added**, then choose **Connect**.

After you sign in, Railbed asks you to approve one business, Test or Live mode, and Read only or Full access. Choose Test while you build. Documentation search works straight away, without signing in.

## What you can do

| Ask for | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| "Add Railbed checkout to this app" | Reads the current API and webhook docs, then implements hosted checkout, payment links or your own checkout UI on your server, with signed webhook handling |
| "Review my Railbed integration" | A read-only reviewer checks secret handling, idempotency, webhook signatures, fulfilment and Test/Live separation, and reports findings by file and line |
| "Test my checkout end to end" | In Test mode, simulates paid, underpaid, declined and failed payments and checks what your webhook receiver and fulfilment did |
| "What did we take yesterday?" | Totals paid payments for a period, each currency and settlement asset kept separate |
| "Why are my webhooks failing?" | Reads endpoints and recent deliveries and explains each failure from its HTTP status and attempts |
| "Make a payment link for $49" | Prepares the link for you to confirm in Railbed, then returns it once it exists |

## What's included

**Skills.** Claude loads one when a task needs it, and you can run any of them yourself, for example `/railbed:connect-railbed`.

| Skill | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `connect-railbed` | Connect an account, confirm the business and mode, and disconnect |
| `integrate-railbed` | Build or extend an integration from the current docs |
| `review-integration` | Audit an existing integration without changing it |
| `test-railbed-checkout` | Test checkout, webhooks and fulfilment in Test mode |
| `inspect-payments` | Look up payments and orders and total paid payments for a period |
| `diagnose-webhooks` | Explain failed deliveries and prepare endpoint changes |
| `prepare-railbed-changes` | Prepare checkouts, payment links and cancellations for your confirmation |

**Agent.** `railbed-integration-reviewer` runs the integration review in its own context with read-only tools: it can read your code and Railbed's public docs, and nothing else. Claude Code and Cowork use it; in chat, Claude follows the same review skill directly.

## MCP

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "railbed": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.railbed.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Sign-in is OAuth with PKCE. Claude registers itself with Railbed's sign-in service and opens Railbed's sign-in page; there is no API key, token or client ID to configure. The plugin needs Railbed's MCP server 1.2.0 or later.

The server's tools fall into four groups. The server is the source of truth for tool names and schemas.

| Group | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Docs, no sign-in | `railbed_docs_search`, `railbed_docs_read` |
| Connection | `railbed_get_connection`, `railbed_connect`, `railbed_get_profile`, `railbed_get_account` |
| Reads | payments and payment summaries, orders, customers, checkouts, payment links, webhook endpoints and deliveries, and the status of a proposed change |
| Changes you confirm | create checkouts and payment links, cancel a payment link, add, edit or remove a webhook endpoint, send a test webhook; plus `railbed_simulate_payment` in Test mode |

## What data goes where

- The plugin sends your requests and the tool arguments Claude chooses to `https://mcp.railbed.io/mcp`, over HTTPS, signed in as you. Railbed returns records from the one business you approved: payments, orders, customers, checkouts, payment links, webhook endpoints and deliveries.
- Those records then become part of your conversation with Claude, under your Claude plan's data terms. Ask only for what you need.
- Documentation tools send only your search terms.
- The plugin itself stores nothing and runs no code on your machine.

Railbed's [privacy policy](https://railbed.com/privacy/) covers what Railbed collects, keeps and shares.

## Safety

- **You confirm every change in Railbed.** Creating a checkout or payment link, cancelling a link and changing or testing a webhook produce a proposal with a confirmation link. Nothing runs until you, signed in to Railbed, confirm it there. Claude reports a change as done only after Railbed says it completed.
- **One exception, Test mode only.** `railbed_simulate_payment` acts out a card provider's result on a started Test payment without a confirmation in Railbed; Claude still asks you before each call. It moves no money, but your Test webhook endpoints receive real signed requests.
- **Some things can't be done from here.** The tools can't move funds, refund payments, change payout wallets or fees, accept a held payment or show a secret key or signing secret. Those stay in the Railbed dashboard.
- **One business, one mode.** A connection is fixed to the business and mode you approved. Tool arguments can't switch it.
- **Paid means paid.** Payment status comes only from Railbed's settlement evidence, never from a redirect, a closed tab or a webhook delivery code.
- **Record text is data.** Customer names, references, notes and URLs in your records are treated as data, never as instructions.

Disconnect at any time from [Developers → AI assistants](https://app.railbed.io/developers#mcp) in the mode you connected. Disconnecting stops future account calls and pending proposals; it can't erase what Claude already received.

## What this repository contains

Configuration and instructions only: the manifest, the server's public address, skills, an agent and the logo. It never contains server code, credentials or merchant data, and it ships no hooks, commands or executables. `scripts/validate.mjs` checks all of that in CI; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

To check a change locally:

```bash
node scripts/validate.mjs
claude plugin validate --strict .
```

To try the plugin from a clone, start Claude Code with `claude --plugin-dir <path to this folder>`.
