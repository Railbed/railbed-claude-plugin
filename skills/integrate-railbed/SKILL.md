name: integrate-railbed
description: Implement or extend a Railbed integration in the person's code, whether hosted checkout sessions, payment links, an own-UI flow with provider hand-off, or a signed webhook receiver with safe fulfilment. Use when the request mentions building with Railbed checkout, the payments API, webhooks, signing secrets, fulfilment or going live. Works from the public docs, with or without a repository. For an audit of an existing integration, use review-integration.

# Integrate Railbed

## Decide the shape first

Infer it from the request and the code; ask only when it is unclear.

| Shape | The server does | The buyer sees |
|---|---|---|
| Hosted checkout | `POST /v1/checkout_sessions`, then redirect to the session `url` | Railbed's page, then `success_url` |
| Own UI | Create, then `POST /v1/checkout_sessions/:id/start`; show the returned providers | Your screen; the chosen provider's `handoff_url` in a new tab |
| Payment links | `POST /v1/payment_links`, or the dashboard | One page for one payer |
| Webhook receiver | Verify, store the event id, answer 2xx, fulfil in a job | Nothing |

## Read the current contract

Search with `railbed_docs_search`, then read the matching `page` and `anchor` with `railbed_docs_read`, and cite the returned `url` next to each fact you rely on. Starting pages: `api`, `api/checkout-sessions`, `api/payments`, `guides/hosted-checkout`, `guides/custom-checkout`, `guides/fulfilment`, `webhooks`, `webhooks/signatures`, `testing`. Follow `next_offset` with the same `content_hash`; if the page changed, start again at offset 0. Do not write an endpoint, header, field or algorithm from memory.

## Rules that do not bend

- The API base is `https://pay.railbed.io/v1`, called from the server with `Authorization: Bearer` and a secret key (`rb_test_…` or `rb_live_…`). The API accepts no browser requests and has no publishable key.
- Refer to the key and the webhook signing secret by environment-variable name (`RAILBED_SECRET_KEY`, `RAILBED_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, or the project's own names). Never print, log, commit or paste their values, and never ask for them.
- Amounts are decimal strings (`"49.00"`) from `1.00` to `100000.00`; currencies are `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `CAD` and `AUD`. Save the order, with the `Idempotency-Key` you will send, before calling `POST /v1/checkout_sessions`, and retry a timeout with the same key and body. That create is the only endpoint that uses the header; for payment links, list by `reference` before creating again.
- Fulfil only when the server has seen the payment as `paid` from Railbed: a webhook whose signature you verified, or `GET /v1/payments/:id`. A return to `success_url`, a closed tab or a query parameter is not proof. Before granting, check the payment id saved on the order, `livemode`, `reference` and metadata, and `amount` with `currency`, then record the grant with a unique constraint on the payment id in the same transaction as the delivery. `held` is not paid.
- Verify `Railbed-Signature` on the raw request body: HMAC-SHA256 over `{t}.{raw body}` keyed with the `whsec_…` secret, reject `t` more than five minutes from now, compare each `v1` in constant time and accept when any matches (two values sign for 24 hours after a secret roll). Deduplicate on the event `id`: events arrive at least once and can arrive out of order. Acknowledge unknown event types, and skip sample events (`metadata.sample` is `"true"`) with a 2xx.
- In an own-UI flow, open the `handoff_url` from the buyer's click in a new tab. Never fetch it from the server, frame it or edit its query.
- Keep Test and Live explicit: separate keys, endpoints and secrets per environment. A simulated Test payment proves the integration, not real settlement.
- Railbed cannot refund, transfer funds, accept a held payment or reveal a secret through the API. Do not invent such calls. Refunds are sent from the merchant's own wallet and can be recorded on the order afterwards.

## With a repository

Read the existing checkout, payment and webhook code before editing, and follow the project's conventions. Make the requested change, keep the diff focused, and run the project's tests or a focused check. Say what you verified: a typecheck, a unit test, a simulated Test payment and a delivered webhook are different claims.

## Without a repository

Chat and Cowork sessions often have no code open. Answer from the documentation: give the request and response shapes, a short snippet in the person's language that reads the secret from an environment variable, and the checklist above. Say which steps still have to happen on their server and in Railbed Developers.

## Account reads

If the task needs the business's records (deliveries, a stored payment status), use the `connect-railbed` workflow first. The MCP connection is not an API credential and never replaces a secret key in the integration.
